session used to handle the token through server and not pass it to the front right now.

req.session.token : includes the token that been generated using JWT , then the authorize function gonna
check and verfiy that token using JWT if true lets store the user._id in the req.user that been handled by session
so the authorization functionality works as expected: only the coach that signed in can CRUD only his courses.
